#### Can I work with a team?
You can! Several limitations:
- Each of you must put in at least 125+ hours of work. This will be done via written updates
- Your budget is still limited to $250 USD for the entire device

#### Do I *need* a 3D printer to try this?
You don't! However it is *incredibly* hard to do so without a printer so I highly, *highly* recommend you have a 3D printer by the time your parts arrive. You'll need it to iterate and modify your design quickly, since it's not going to work on the first try. Trust me
