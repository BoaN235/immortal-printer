So i finished watching this video, and i think that I'm ready for the cad part, I still have to choose the size of the printer, but i think that it'll be around the same as an Ender 3. as soon as i can i'll start doing some research for parts like the printing bed, the stepper motors and the touchscreen display to start planning the BOM

Research: 30m
