The B0lta will be a 3D printer designed to have a large print volume(300x300x300mm) and operate at a reasonably fast speed. It will run klipper on a Raspberry Pi Zero W and BTT E3 SKR MINI V3.0. This page serves as documentation and a journal for the project.

The requirements, both self-imposed and external:
- Cost 300USD or less
- Have at least a 300x300x300mm print volume
- Have a heated bed
- Support at least PLA filament and preferably PETG too
- Use standard 1.75mm filament
- Have a decent lifetime(i.e. at least a year or two with maintence when small things go wrong)
- Be FULLY open source

02/03/2025: I started a couple of days ago(I think on the first?), and got a decent base going. Onshape is [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/04c816b208815cfe2337ffc9/w/26ab92a225f22313e2db688c/e/48f805e7421d68b7479e075a). Here's a screenshot of the model so far:

02/03/2025(2): Thinking about design and goals. I'm thinking that I'm going to do a heated bed, klipper firmware, BTT E3 SKR MINI V3.0 + Rpi Zero W for microcontrollers, maybe 300x300x300mm print volume, and probably CoreXY or a misc Cartesian motion system. Right now I'm mostly using 2020 extrusion to block out the design, and I'll probably continue to do that. The main gimmick of this printer will honestly probably be the size of the printable area lol. For motion system again, I might use a custom system but no matter what it will be cartesian, polar systems are too weird both mechanically and coordinate-wise. I'll work more on the 3d model today and have already expanded the size of the base a lot to match up with the print volume.
